# Mega Man 2D

* This project is to practice my skills developing a 2d platform game using new features from Unity version 2017.2 (Worldbuilding in 2D using Tilemap and 2D Cinemachine).
* I'm using as base an Armored Armadillo level from Capcomâ€™s Mega Man X game. Mega Man is a brand copyrighted by Capcom, so don't get crazy ideas about earning money with it. 
* All sprites used in this project are from normal searches on Google images.
